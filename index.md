- Embeddings are a set of models that can convert text into a numerical form, called embedding, which is a numerical representation of the input text.

- FM VS LLMs To build the first version of ChatGPT, a model called GPT-3.5 served as the foundation model. This means that OpenAI used some chat-specific data to create a tuned version of GPT-3.5 that was specialized in performing well in conversational scenarios, such as chatbots.

**Key points to remember:**

1. Artificial intelligence refers to the ability of a machine to learn patterns and make predictions. AI does not replace human decisions; instead, AI adds value to human judgment.

2. AI performs tasks without human intervention and completes mundane and repetitive tasks, while augmented intelligence allows humans to make final decisions after analyzing data, reports, and other types of data.

3. The three levels of AI include: Narrow AI, Broad AI, and General AI. Narrow AI and Broad AI are available today. In fact, most enterprises use Broad AI. General AI won't come online until sometime in the future.

4. The history of AI has progressed across the Era of Tabulation, Era of Programming, and Era of AI.

5. Data can be structured, unstructured, or semi-structured. 
    Structured data is quantitative and highly organized, such as a spreadsheet of data. 
    Unstructured data is qualitative data that doesn't have structure, such as medical records. It's becoming increasing valuable to businesses. 
    And semi-structured data combines features of both structured data and unstructured data. It uses metadata.

6. About 80% of all the data in today's world is unstructured.

7. Machine learning has advantages compared to programmable computers. Machine learning can predict and machine learning learns!

8. Machine learning uses three methods.
    Supervised learning requires enough examples to make accurate predictions.
    Unsupervised learning requires large amounts of information so the machine can ask a question, and then figure out how to answer the question by itself.
    Reinforcement learning requires the process of trial and error.

9. With AI everywhere, AI will move into all industries, from finance, to education, to healthcare.

10. AI can increase productivity, create new opportunities, provide deeper insights, and enable personalization.
